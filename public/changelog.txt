- Updated all views and controllers to reflect new roles permissions
- Gave users ability to update their own profile (to an extent)
- Fixed anchor links on Constitution, Facebook polls, FAQs and team directory pages
- Changed layout of Constitution, Facebook polls, FAQs to use the accordion widget
- Adjusted the users#index (/members) payouts tables to be condensed
- Overrode as_json for User to dump out display_name and total_winnings for use with amCharts
- Moved NFL Players to the end of the navigation, before Admin Login 
- Added this_is_a_buyout boolean to Contract to better manage the buyout subcontracts (just like with extensions and buyouts)

- Brought back "The League" panel to the root page, users#index and teams#show on medium devices
