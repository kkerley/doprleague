==========

The world's first* dynasty league fantasy football management system (DLFFMS).

This site is the home of the Disciples of Philip Rivers dynasty league and is serving as a replacement for a grossly unmanagement .xslx file containing team rosters and all pertinent league info. 

*NOTE:* despite the 2.x version numbers currently on the site, this is still VERY much a beta product with lazy code throughout. At the moment, I'm more concerned with getting everything working as it should without much regard for how clean or proper the code is. I AM going through and cleaning it up, refactoring, rewriting and so forth to make the code correct and as Rubylike as possible, but please forgive any sloppy code found at the moment.



* No gaurantee this is at all true.
